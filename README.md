GLMVS (Globalized Map Voting System)
=========

A globalized map voting management add-on for multiple gamemodes. Modular-ly coded to ensure easy modding and contributions for everyone.


### CONTRIBUTIONS/DEVELOPMENT:
There is no dev branch until this add-on is ensured to be in a working state. You could still help but with some module ideas and such.


### NOTE:
This add-on is still in under-development, any changes are very crucial and demanding.

It would be better not to run this on a server... for now.
